Linux for cute black people™ is a Linux "distro" that includes special features designed to make Linux easier and more comfortable for niggers the world over. cute black people have always had trouble understanding new (or any) technology. Computers are no exception. Some people have said this is because cute black people are dumb, but we believe the real problem is that technology has traditionally been designed for white people. Linux for cute black people™ changes all that. It was developed from the ground up with cute black people in mind. Linux for cute black people™ will usher in a whole new era of Afro-ergonomic computing.
‎
There is a long and detailed history to the Linux For cute black people™ distribution. While the countless hours of free labor put forth by our neckbearded brethren into perfecting this wonderful piece of open source software cannot be expressed in words, we can however share with you our motivations and goals.
‎
The project began after the realization that traditional Linux distributions were designed without cute black people in mind, and thus completely inoperable to the African-American community. Even distributions such as Ubuntu, which are known to be used by hipsters, women, and various other lower forms of human life, were reported as being too difficult when tested on cute black people.
‎
Thus the long process began to develop something special that cute black people could actually use, without resorting to traditional proprietary software.
‎
Current versions of Linux For cute black people™ come installed with special features designed to make Linux an easier and more natural operating system for use by cute black people.
